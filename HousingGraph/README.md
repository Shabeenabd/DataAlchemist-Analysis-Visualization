# 🏠 Hosing Graph
In the world of data analysis, the journey often begins with raw, unrefined data. Enter data cleaning in SQL—a meticulous process that transforms a cluttered dataset into a polished gem of insights. With housing data as the canvas, this practice becomes paramount to revealing accurate trends and making informed decisions.

Data cleaning in SQL involves a series of precise steps:
- Handling Missing Values: Detecting and filling or removing missing values ensures the integrity of the dataset, preventing skewed analysis.
- Addressing Outliers: Identifying and managing outliers maintains the dataset's reliability by reducing the impact of anomalies.
- Standardizing Formats: Ensuring consistent formats for data like dates, addresses, or currencies guarantees accurate computations.
- Resolving Duplicates: Detecting and eliminating duplicate entries maintains data integrity and prevents skewing results.
- Handling Incorrect Values: Identifying and rectifying incorrect data entries minimizes the risk of incorrect conclusions.
