**1)  My COVID-19 Data Analysis Journey with SQL**

 In a world shaped by the pandemic, I embarked on a compelling journey of data exploration, armed with SQL as my compass. My project revolved around analyzing COVID-19 data, unraveling patterns and insights hidden within the numbers.

**Project Essence:**
With SQL, I delved into the heart of COVID-19 data, extracting meaningful information from its chaotic sea. The project encompassed cleaning, transforming, and querying the data to gain clarity on how the virus had impacted our lives.

**Key Achievements:**

1. **Taming the Data:** My journey began with taming raw data—cleaning it, converting it into a structured format, and ensuring its accuracy.

2. **Unearthing Trends:** SQL's querying prowess allowed me to uncover trends and correlations. I visualized infection rates over time, unveiling the virus's journey.

3. **Mapping the Spread:** With geospatial capabilities, I painted a vivid picture of the virus's geographical spread, revealing hotspots and their evolution.

4. **Temporal Insights:** I navigated through time, observing how the pandemic's dynamics shifted. Through queries, I witnessed recoveries, spikes, and trends.

5. **Impact of Interventions:** SQL helped me gauge the impact of interventions by analyzing how they influenced infection rates.

**Discoveries and Impact:**
My COVID-19 data analysis using SQL uncovered significant insights:
- Visualizing infection waves guided our understanding of the pandemic's course.
- Mapping transmission patterns empowered decisions on resource allocation.
- Analyzing intervention effectiveness steered policies and public health strategies.

**Closing Thoughts:**
My SQL-driven journey into COVID-19 data analysis has been an enlightening adventure. As the world grapples with the pandemic's uncertainties, my project stands as a testament to the power of data analysis in navigating complex challenges and making informed decisions that shape our present and future.

In a world where information is a guiding light, my SQL project has illuminated the path forward, proving the remarkable impact of technology and data-driven insights in the face of global adversity.

3)  Data Cleaning in SQL for Housing Data

In the world of data analysis, the journey often begins with raw, unrefined data. Enter data cleaning in SQL—a meticulous process that transforms a cluttered dataset into a polished gem of insights. With housing data as the canvas, this practice becomes paramount to revealing accurate trends and making informed decisions.

Data cleaning in SQL involves a series of precise steps:

- Handling Missing Values: Detecting and filling or removing missing values ensures the integrity of the dataset, preventing skewed analysis.
- Addressing Outliers: Identifying and managing outliers maintains the dataset's reliability by reducing the impact of anomalies.
- Standardizing Formats: Ensuring consistent formats for data like dates, addresses, or currencies guarantees accurate computations.
- Resolving Duplicates: Detecting and eliminating duplicate entries maintains data integrity and prevents skewing results.
- Handling Incorrect Values: Identifying and rectifying incorrect data entries minimizes the risk of incorrect conclusions.
